# Psych Deluxe Utilities

Modding made mildly easier.  
A collection of browser-based tools to assist with Psych Deluxe modding, built with simplicity and vibes in mind.

## What's Inside?

- **Lyrics to JSON Converter**  
  Quickly turn your lyric `.srt` `.lrc` and `.txt` files into Psych Deluxe-compatible JSON lyrics. It's fast, lightweight, and doesn't ask for your mother's maiden name.

- **(WIP) Dialogue Creator**  
  A drag-and-drop style interface for building in-game dialogues. Currently just sitting pretty and disabled. Coming soon™.

- **Theme & Font Customizer**  
  Switch between a bunch of preset themes and fonts. Because modding tools should look as good as your charts sound.

## Standalone Version

## Features

- Completely client-side — no data ever leaves your browser
- Works offline (just open the HTML!)
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks, no fluff)
- Respects your privacy — check out our fun [Privacy Policy](privacy.html)

## Why?

Because not every tool needs to be bloated or overengineered. This is for modders who just want to get things done without launching a 2GB app.

- Don't sell it for money.
